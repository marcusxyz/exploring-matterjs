Make sure to check the controls below before visiting the [page](#)


### Controls 
- Click anywhere to spawn random objects and throw them around
- `W` `A` `S` `D` to manipulate gravity `space` to go back to zero gravity


## Insights

- Ragdolls can be a bit tricky, throwing them around can sometimes result in random bursts of movement
- Document is alright, I ended up learning matterjs via other sites and forums
- Engine is being actively maintained
- Good demo examples on their [website](https://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#mixed)

## Ideas with matterjs

Create a interactive section for a portfolio website. For example see hero and footer section on these sites:
